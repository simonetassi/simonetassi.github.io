This is the first playlist I am releasing and features some of the grooviest Brazilian tracks I know.

You can stream it directly on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3JBpcs2xKKKFJpkHS3EKwY?si=f1a7c872a0854f8a) or download the playlist file attached to this article.

My passion for Brazilian music started long ago, when, while looking for new jazz records to listen to, I found [_Getz/Gilberto_](https://www.discogs.com/master/85178-Stan-Getz-Joao-Gilberto-Getz-Gilberto), considered a bossa nova masterpiece, and I instantly fell in love with its sound.
What truly fascinated me was the sound of the Portuguese language (that I had never had the chance to appreciate before), and how it mixed perfectly with the syncopated guitar rhythms. From that moment, I started my journey into the world of Brazilian sounds, from bossa nova to MPB, discovering great artists and growing my curiosity for the country.

While discovering more and more music, I was drawn to jazz-funk records that stood out for their refined but not overbearing harmonies, which, mixed with groovy rhythms and uplifting melodies, create an irresistibly vibrant and soulful atmosphere.

This playlist marks an important stop along my musical journeyâ€”an eclectic collection of hidden gems that I believe everyone should hear at least once. Each track comes from an outstanding album, so if you feel like diving deeper into the genre, I highly recommend giving the full records a listen. You won't be disappointed.



Enjoy!

I am a Software Developer from Bologna, Italy. I am currently studying for a Computer Science Master's Degree at [University of Bologna](https://unibo.it/en) and working part-time as a Software Engineer at [Archeion](https://archeion.tech).

My main interests include:
- Internet of Things and Web of Things
- Simulation and Digital Twins
- Distributed Systems and Blockchain

Apart from my academic/professional interests, music accompanies me throughout my days in various formsâ€”from playing electric guitar and DJing at local venues to building my record collection. Each aspect offers a creative counterbalance to my technical work.
My tastes particularly lean towards Jazz, World Music and (Deep) House but I am always ready to dig into new artists and genres.

I particoularly enjoy reading and I keep track of what's on [my shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177877174). 

Here is my [curriculm vitae](simone-tassi-cv.pdf).
